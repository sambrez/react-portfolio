# react-portfolio

## Description

This repository contains the code of a single-page application built using React that features a portfolio showcasing my work and progress while studying web development.

The application includes a small biography, my resume, a contact form, and a list of six of my latest projects.

This is my first application built from scratch using React. While I am still getting familiar with React, I did find this project challenging and fulfilling and it provides me with a great base to build upon. I look forward to maintaining the site as a way to showcase my progress as a web developer!

## Installation
Install the necessary npm packages for this app by running npm install in your terminal.

## Credits
I would like to thank the AskBCS Learning Assitants who helped me troubleshoot two issues I was experiencing while building this application. Morgan helped me to resolve an issue regarding prop validation in one of my components. With his assistance I was able to find and correct syntax errors affecting the passing oof props between components. Sebastian on the other hand helped me to resolve another simple syntax error regarding the import of two components in my App.jsx file.
